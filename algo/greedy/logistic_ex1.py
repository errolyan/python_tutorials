#The model will expect a 2D array, so we must reshape
#For the model, the 2D array must have rows equal to the number of samples,
#and columns equal to the number of features.
#For this example, we have 1000 samples and 1 feature.
x = x.reshape((-1, 1))

#For each point, y is a pass/fail for the grade. The simple threshold is arbitrary,
#and can be changed as you would like. Classes are 1 for success and 0 for failure

#Our goal will be to train a logistic regression model to do pass/fail to the same threshold.

#Finally, output the results, formatted for nicer viewing.
#The format is [<sample value>]: Class <class number>, probability [ <probability for class 0> <probability for class 1>]
#So, the probability array is the probability of failure, followed by the probability of passing.
#In an example run, [7]: Class 0, probability [  9.99966694e-01   3.33062825e-05]
#Means that for value 7, the class is 0 (failure) and the probability of failure is 99.9%
